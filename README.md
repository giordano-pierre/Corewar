# Corewar Project

## Description

The Corewar project is a programming game where participants create small assembly programs called "warriors" that compete for control over a virtual computer's memory. This project is divided into two parts: the assembler (asm) and the virtual machine (vm).

### Assembler (asm)

The assembler, also known as asm, is responsible for translating human-readable assembly code into machine code that the virtual machine can execute. It takes assembly programs written in a specific language and converts them into bytecode instructions. The bytecode instructions represent the actions to be performed by the virtual machine.

The assembly language used in Corewar is designed to provide low-level control over the virtual machine's memory and execution flow. Participants can use a combination of instructions and directives to define the behavior of their warriors.

### Virtual Machine (vm)

The virtual machine (vm) is the environment where the warriors battle for control. It emulates a computer system with its own memory and execution cycle. The vm loads the bytecode generated by the assembler and executes the instructions contained in each warrior.

During the battle, the warriors take turns executing their instructions, manipulating the memory and trying to eliminate their opponents. The goal is to survive and be the last warrior standing.

The virtual machine also provides various debugging and visualization features to help participants analyze the state of the battle and optimize their warriors' strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Corewar project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the assembler (asm) and the virtual machine (vm) using the provided build scripts.
3. Write your own assembly program or modify the existing examples.
4. Use the assembler (asm) to translate your assembly program into bytecode.
5. Run the virtual machine (vm) with the generated bytecode to start the battle.
6. Analyze the results and refine your strategy.

For detailed instructions on building and running the Corewar project, refer to the project documentation.

## Acknowledgements

The Corewar project is inspired by the original Core War game created by D. G. Jones and A. K. Dewdney in 1984. We would like to express our gratitude to the creators and contributors of the original game for their pioneering work.
